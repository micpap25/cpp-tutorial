## micpap25's code & records for learning C++

### My personal rules:

* I used VSCode and clang for this. I don't think I opened VS once. So there isn't much configuration in the .vscode folder.

* clang compiles with C++ 14 automatically. When compiling these remember to use `-std=c++20` as an option to set the C++ version.
    * Also remember to set the version for VSCode Intellisense to the version you want.

* If something's not included and it's in Java, it's the same as it is there.
    * I still included things that I found particularly interesting or useful.

* If something's not included and it's not in Java, it's bad practice and thus I didn't try to learn it.
